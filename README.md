## Introduction

A tequila company has amassed an extensive collection of sales data from its global market operations. This project aims to steer the company toward a data-centric approach, transforming raw data into strategic insights that drive business decisions.

## Problem Statement

The company boasts an array of tequila products and a substantial market presence. However, the absence of a data-driven framework has led to underutilized sales data. The project seeks to address critical challenges:

- Identifying the most lucrative markets and products.
- Assessing the impact of marketing strategies and brand ambassador engagements.
- Optimizing pricing to improve profit margins.
- Targeting sales efforts to boost the monthly sales rate per account.

The outcomes of this project are pivotal for developing an informed sales strategy.

## Industry-Specific Challenges

Tequila, as a controlled substance, presents distinct challenges in the market. The United States enforces a three-tier system separating production, distribution, and retail, while Canadian provinces maintain their own regulatory controls. For the company, it is imperative to:

- Adhere to the legal frameworks of federal and provincial laws.
- Plan strategically for market entry and growth.
- Align marketing strategies with regional regulations.
- Streamline supply chain management for cost-efficiency and effectiveness.

The data analysis incorporates these regulatory elements to provide compliant and insightful results.
